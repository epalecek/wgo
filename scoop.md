THE SCOOP:
---------------------------------------------------------------
Woah, You are 94 years old!  You are in Magnolia Texas, you've been living with us for over 2 years.

We have two dogs, Ruby (11 years old, black and grey) and Zeppy (3 years old, tan and white and 3 legs!)

Ms. Cherie, a home health worker, comes by the house on Mondays/Wednesdays/Fridays from 10:00am to 2:00pm to check up on you, and help with anything you need.  This will help Walker and I make sure you're healthy and taken care of while we work, or if we are out of the house.
She can help with almost anything: Breakfast/Coffee/Laundry/Showers etc...  Just ask!

Thanksgiving week is almost here!   We are hosting about 15-20 people on Thursday for Turkey, Ham, and festivities.  And speaking of Thanksgiving:

Joe is flying down to Austin (about 3 hours West of here) to visit Ralph.  Joe wants to come out and see you while he is in Texas, so he and Ralph are driving here on Wednesday 11/26!  WOOHOO!
