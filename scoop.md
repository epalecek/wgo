THE SCOOP:

Woah, You are 94 years old!  You are in Magnolia Texas, you've been living with us for over 2 years.

We have two dogs, Ruby (11 years old, black and grey) and Zeppy (3 years old, tan and white and 3 legs!)

Ms. Cherie, a home health worker, comes by the house on Mondays/Wednesdays/Fridays from 10:00am to 2:00pm to check up on you, and help with anything you need.  This will help Walker and I make sure you're healthy and taken care of while we work, or if we are out of the house.
She can help with almost anything: Breakfast/Coffee/Laundry/Showers etc...  Just ask!

Last week was Thanksgiving, we had a houseful of people!  Joe and Ralph drove in from Austin the day before Thanksgiving and hung out with you for a couple of hours!  

Ohio State beat Michigan on Saturday, they are 12-0 and #1 in the country right now, GO BUCKS!
